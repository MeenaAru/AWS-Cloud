**Instance Storage** - Ephemeral in nature. One to one relationship between ec2 and instance storage.
**EBS (Elastic Block Storage)** - External storage which can grow. 1 EBS volume can be mounted only on 1 EC2 instance and both should be in the same AZ.
                              1 ec2 can have more than 1 EBS volumes
                                - Work loads -> usually General Purpose Volume
                                - Databases -> usually IOPS (small data but frequently retrieved)
                                - Big Data / Data warehouses -> usually Throughput ( big data files)
                                - Cold HDD -> Cold File Servers (lowest IOPS before moving to Magnetic)
**EFS (Elastic File Storage)** - Any number of EC2 instances can be linked to one EFS for both read and write. Application has to handle concurrency. 
                                 It automatically scales. 
                                 Requires one mount target for a availability zone. The azs can have more than one subnet. The mount target  will have an IP address.
                                 Need to open 2049 (NFS) for internal traffic on the ec2 instance's security group.
                                 Life Cycle management - AWS has a set of predefined rules to move files to infrequently accessed, we need to choose which we want.
                                 Max I/O option- When many instances access the EFS then we can give this option when creating the EFS.We cant use it after the EFS has been created.
                                 Policies can be attached to EFS. Security groups allow or deny access to the files under EFS and the Degree of access is controled by Polices.
                                 
**S3 (Simple Storage Service)** - Previous storages where block storage. S3 is object storage.Can use lambda to access the S3. 
                                    Contents available in S3 are distributed by CDN and cloud front uses it to cache the contents are available near the user.
                                    Event can be triggered based on the availability of the S3 Objects
                                    Can use CLI to load or dowoad or process objects using shell scripts.
                                    Objects can be made accessible to only the required users.
                                    Can replicate the data in another region.
