Four ways of accessing the cloud
# 1. AWS Management Console
UI way of accessing the cloud services, used by non technical users.

# 2. AWS SDK
Developers can use this. Available in many programming languages. Good choice for automation, custom applications.

# 3. AWS CLI
Great choice for scripting, which helps automations, not good for custom applications. Used mainly be system administrators and operational engineers.

# 4. 3rd Party Tool Sets
These use either SDK or CLI internally to access resources.
