# AWS Region
Geographically isolated locations, that have atleast a minimum of 3 isolated and physically separate Availability zones.

# Availability Zones
Actual locations that have one or more data centers with redundant power, networking and connectivity inside a region.

# Local Zones
AWS Local Zones place compute, storage, database, and other **select AWS services** closer to end-users to easily run highly-demanding applications that require single-digit millisecond latencies to your end-users. Provides a high-bandwidth, secure connection between local workloads and those running in the AWS Region, through which the users can access all the other available services.

# AWS Wavelength Zones
Acccessing application through mobile, will be more faster when the compute and storage AWS services are available within the mobile network providers 5G network. This is made possible through AWS wavelenght zones.

# AWS Outposts
Brings AWS services to on-premise data centre. This is very helpfull when the company has compliance related requirements

# Edgelocations
Edge locations are used for caching content and used for content delivery network CDN.

# Cloudfront
Cloundfront is AWS's CDN(content delivery network). Static images, dynamic web pages and live or on-demand media streaming can be delivered with high speed through any datacentres called as edgelocations. CloudFront actually has two tiers of edge location: edge points of presence (POPs) and regional edge caches (RECs). Edge POPs are more numerous and closer to users, but they have smaller caches. Regional edge caches are fewer and further away, but each one has more storage, so they can cache content for longer.
