# Jobs of Load balancer:
- Distribute traffic to the respective target servers.
- Be scalable(Its elastic and is not a single point of failure)
- Able to support distribution algorithms(when there multiple target servers, choose the appropriate one using algorithms)
- Support registration of target servers(check whether they are active or not)
- Can be internal or Internet facing applications
- Route requests to different versions of application(canary deployment)
- Support Identity provider integrations(eg sign in using google or facebook login)

# Types Of Load Balancers:
- Application Load Balancer -- Operates at level 7, Can deal with HTTP or HTTPs traffic
- Network Load Balancer --- Operates at layer 4 (TCP, UDP)
- Gateway Load Balancers -- Operates at layer 3

# Application Load Balancer Properties
- ALB will have more than one nodes in different AZs to avoid one ponit of failure.
- Listeners matches some rules and directs the traffic to the appropriate target.
- Targets (Bunch of ec2 instances)
- Selection algorithm is used by the listener to choose the right target
- Health check configuration is required to be set in a Target group.The actual health service runs on the target ec2 instance.
- Back Pressure-- Ability to dynamically route the load to other ec2 instances, when the current ec2 istance is fully occupied with some back ground job. So the instance can send a health check saying not ok and then complete the job which they are currently working on. Once they are done with whatever job they are running, they can send a health check that they are ok and ready to take loads.
- Target groups should be set in atleast 2 different AZs for a ALB
- Crosszone Load Balancing--Each node can distribute the traffic within multiple availability zones, so that one zone is not overloaded.(This property is always enabled)
- Authentication of users-- Authentication can be done at the ALB, leaving the application to concentrate on bussiness requirements.

# Network Load Balancer
- Uses Flowhash to identify the ec2 instance to send the request
- Doest not have path based routing
- Does not have authentication flow
- Good for devices sending multiple chunks and assemble them in the same target ec2.

# Gateway Load Balancer
GLB recevies the request and sends it to security appliances. When the security appliance sends a response saying that its safe, the GLB diverts the traffic to the appropriate node.

# Target Group Features
- Name
- Target Type
  - LB
  - IP
  - Lambda
  - Instances
- protocol port
- Network VPC
- Health Check
  - Protocol (HTTP/S)
  - Path(Health)
  - Threshold
  - Success Codes
