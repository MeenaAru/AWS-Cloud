**EC2 is a resoucre sepecifc to an AZ in a region. Its a VM running the OS along with the application, can connect to a virtual cloud using elastic virtual network interface.**

# Things to be considered while creating an EC2 instance:
## Tags
A name for the AWS service, used for categorizing. Has 2 properties Key and Value. **Name** is a special Key, which is mandatory.

## Instance Type
Determines the hardware.
There are current generation and previous generation VMs.
Broadly categorized into
- General Purpose
- Compute Optimized
- Memory Optimized
- Storage Optimized

## AMI(Amazon Machine Image)-Operating System
AWS provides OS or OS+application.
AMIs are very usefull in lift and shift where the AWS provides tools to create AMI created for the on-premise server and it can be moved to cloud.

## Storage - Usually EBS( Elastic Block Storage)
Disks for the EC2 instance where the AMI OS or OS+Application is stored, that can be either SSD or HDD. Can have 1 or more volumes.

## Network
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is a region, that has subnets (AZs) where the EC2 will be launched.
Each EC2 instance will have a primary network interface card by default. There can be multiple network interface cards(eg internal network, outside traffic) called as **ENI elastic network interface**. This is used to attach the instance to the VPC
Each ENI can be associated with security rules.

## Security
- Keypair (Has 2 keys)
  - Public Key -- used to encrypt the message that is to be sent
  - Private Key AWS will allow us to download the private key only when creating a key pair (Called as PEM file- Privacy Enhanced Mail) used when trying to SSH.
  - PEM -->SSH through shell
  - PPK -->SSH through putty

- Security Group (Virtual Firewall)
This is attached to the ENI. Controls the bidirectional traffic.
  - Inbound Rules(Controls inbound traffic)
  - Outbound Rules
  - Statefull (Keeps track of both to and fro traffic)
Security Group has a Type column that can be SSH,RDP etc. Using this we can determine from where the EC2 can be accessed.
