** Instance Storage ** - Ephemeral in nature. One to one relationship between ec2 and instance storage.
** EBS (Elastic Block Storage) ** - External storage which can grow. 1 EBS volume can be mounted only on 1 EC2 instance and both should be in the same AZ.
                              1 ec2 can have more than 1 EBS volumes
** EFS (Elastic File Storage) ** - Any number of EC2 instances can be linked to one EFS for both read and write. Application has to handle concurrency. It automatically scales. 
** S3 (Simple Storage Service) ** - Previous storages where block storage. S3 is object storage.Can use lambda to access the S3. 
                                    Contents available in S3 are distributed by CDN and cloud front uses it to make the contents are available near the user.
                                    Event can be triggered based on the availability of the S3 Objects
                                    Can use CLI to load or dowoad or process objects using shell scripts.
                                    Objects can be made accessible to only the required users.
                                    Can replicate the data in another region.
